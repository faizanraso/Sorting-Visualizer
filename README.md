# Sorting-Visualizer

Created an algorithm visualizer using React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS - https://algos-seven.vercel.app/
<br/>
It currently supports Bubble Sort and Selection Sort, however, more algorithms will be added in the future.

Future plans:
- Support more algorithms (insertion sort, quick sort etc.)
- Add code snippets for the every algorithm
