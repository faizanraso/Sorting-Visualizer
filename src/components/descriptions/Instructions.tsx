            Select an algorithm: Choose the sorting algorithm you want to
            visualize. We currently support Bubble Sort and Selection Sort, but
            we're always adding more! ðŸš€

            Choose array size: Pick the size of the array you want to sort.

            Click the "Run" button to start the visualization. You'll see the
            array displayed as a set of bars. Blue bars indicate the elements
            being scanned, while orange bars indicate the elements being
            swapped.

          <li>
            When the array turns green, you know that the algorithm has
            successfully sorted the array.
